if i'm being honest, i don't think i've ever tried peruvian-latin fusion food, so my lunch today was a nice change! this beautiful arrangement came from lima fusion, located in ferry market, new hope, pennsylvania. it consisted of two empanadas, one pollo, the other ropa vieja, a lima salad, and tostados with guacamole. now, i have no idea what was in the guacamole, but it was incredible! it was saltier and had more lime flavor than guac usually does. i also loved the empanadas, and the sauce that came with them wasn't too spicy at all.
